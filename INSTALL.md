   ```bash
   python -m http.server
2. Open your browser and go to:
  ```http://localhost:8000```

#### Using Node.js (http-server)

1. Install `http-server` globally (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server



2. Serve the files by running:

      ```bash
   http-server
   
3. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8080).</br>
